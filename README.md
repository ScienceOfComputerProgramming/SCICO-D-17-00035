# IOCL: An Interactive Tool for Specifying, Validating and Evaluating OCL Constraints
The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is commonly used for specifying additional constraints on models, in addition, 
to the ones enforced by semantics of the models. However, a lot of practitioners and even researchers are reluctant 
in using OCL to some extent due to the lack of sufficient familiarity with OCL.
To facilitate practitioners and researchers in specifying OCL constraints, we designed and developed a web-based tool 
called interactive OCL (iOCL) for interactively specifying constraints on a given model. The core idea behind iOCL is 
to present and display only relevant details (e.g., operations) of OCL to users at runtime at a given step of 
constraint specification process, in addition to helping modelers with its syntax. We evaluated iOCL using a
real-world case study from Cancer Registry of Norway and the results showed that iOCL can significantly 
reduce the time required to specify OCL constraints and decrease the possibility of making syntactic errors 
during the specification process. Thus, we conclude that iOCL can facilitate the process of OCL constraint 
specification. Interested users can try iOCL at: http://iocl.zen-tools.com/.
